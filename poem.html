  <h4> A lil Poem by Chatgpt (hehe)</h4>
  <pre>
  There are days when the weight feels too much,
  But your words, like a breeze, lift me up with a touch.
  In quiet ways, you’ve been my guide,
  A steady hand, always by my side.

  You’ve shown me strength when I couldn’t see,
  A reminder of who I’m meant to be.
  Your kindness, like a light so pure,
  Has been the strength I’ve held onto for sure.

  You’re the one who quietly leads the way,
  With every word, you make me okay.
  Your support, your care, the way you show,
  Has been a lifeline when I didn’t know.

  I don’t say enough, but know it’s true—
  I’m grateful for all that you do.
  For being the person who’s strong and kind,
  Who makes the world a little more refined.

  So if you ever doubt what you bring,
  Remember this: you’re everything.
  The strength you give, the warmth you share,
  It’s more than I could ever repair.</pre>
